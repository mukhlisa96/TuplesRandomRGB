##  RGB Turtle Random Walk Project

This Python project uses the **turtle** module to create a **colorful random walk**. The turtle moves in random directions while drawing with **random RGB colors**, producing a vibrant, abstract path.

---

###  How It Works

* A turtle named `tim` moves forward in **random directions**: up, down, left, or right.
* Each step uses a **random RGB color**, generated by the `random_color()` function.
* The pen size is set to **15** for bold, visible strokes.
* The turtle moves at the **fastest speed** to quickly generate the design.

###  Concepts Used

* Python `turtle` graphics
* RGB color system (`t.colormode(255)`)
* Random number generation with `random.randint()`
* Lists and random choice (`directions`)
* Loops to repeat actions
